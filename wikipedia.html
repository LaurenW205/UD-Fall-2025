            <p>Oscar Jack Piastri (/piˈæstriː/ pee-AST-ree; born 6 April 2001) is an Australian racing driver who competes in Formula One for McLaren. Piastri has won nine Formula One Grands Prix across three seasons.</p>

            <p>Born and raised in Melbourne, Piastri began his career in radio-controlled racing before moving into karting aged 10, winning several regional titles. Graduating to junior formulae in 2016, Piastri won his first championship at the 2019 Formula Renault Eurocup with R-ace GP. He then won both the 2020 FIA Formula 3 and 2021 FIA Formula 2 Championships back-to-back with Prema, becoming the sixth driver in history to win the GP2/Formula 2 title in their rookie season. Piastri is the only driver in history to win Formula Renault, Formula Three, and Formula Two—or equivalent—championships in successive seasons.</p>

            <p>A member of the Alpine Academy from 2020 to 2022, Piastri signed with McLaren in 2023 to partner Lando Norris, following a contract dispute with Alpine. He made his Formula One debut at the Bahrain Grand Prix, achieving his first career podium in his rookie season at the Japanese Grand Prix. Retaining his seat for 2024, Piastri achieved his maiden victory in Hungary, becoming the fifth Australian driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix, and repeated this feat in Azerbaijan. In 2025, he has taken seven further victories, as well as his maiden pole position at the Chinese Grand Prix, in a title battle with Norris.</p>

            <p>As of the 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Piastri has achieved nine race wins, five pole positions, eight fastest laps, and 24 podiums in Formula One. Piastri is contracted to remain at McLaren until at least the end of the 2028 season.</p>

            <p>Oscar Jack Piastri was born on 6 April 2001 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. His father, Chris Piastri, is the founder and owner of HP Tuners, an automotive software company; the company sponsored his junior formulae career with up to A$6.5 million. He served as Piastri's kart mechanic as he contested national championships in Australia. His mother, Nicole Piastri (née MacFadyen), helped raise him in the suburb of Brighton with his three younger sisters—Hattie, Edie, and Mae. He claims Italian, Yugoslavian, and Chinese heritage from his father, as well as Scottish and Irish from his mother.</p>

            <p>His bedtime stories frequently consisted of automotive books, prompting his father to buy him a radio-controlled car on a business trip when he was six, which he began racing in his backyard.</p>

            <p>Piastri began racing competitively aged nine with Remote Control Racing Australia, winning the secondary class of the national championship before moving into kart racing. Aged 14, he moved with his father—who returned to Melbourne six months later—to Hertford, England, to continue his international racing career in Europe. Having been privately educated at Haileybury, he moved to its sister school in Hertford Heath—whose alumni include Stirling Moss—as a boarding pupil on a sports scholarship. </p>

            <p>By the end of 2015, Piastri began travelling for karting tests and competitions between Italy, France, Belgium, Sweden, Spain, and Portugal from Stansted Airport, costing his father around £250,000. In 2019, he was taken under the wing of nine-time Grand Prix winner Mark Webber and his wife, Ann; the former has served as his manager since and negotiated his move to Formula One.</p>

            <h2 id="Junior">Junior Racing Career</h2>
            <h3>Karting (2011-2016)</h3>
            <p>Following his successes in radio-controlled racing, Piastri moved into kart racing in 2011 at the local Oakleigh Go Kart Racing Club (OGKRC) in Clayton South, aged 10. A protégé of two-time Australian Champion James Sera, he began competing for the club that year in an FA Kart chassis. He won his first title two years later: the 2013 CIK Stars of Karting in the Rookies class. In 2014, he won the OGKRC Championship, City of Melbourne Titles, South Australian Championship, and National Sprint Classic Champion of Champions in Junior Clubman—he claimed a A$500 prize for the latter. He further claimed runner-up in the Australian National Sprint Championship and the Victorian Championship, before progressing to international competition in the IAME International Final at Le Mans; he finished third on his debut in X30 Junior from twenty-first on the grid. He closed his national career with third in the KF3 Australian Championship—where he was ranked the Top Qualifier—as well as victory in the Victorian Championship, OGKRC's Junior Top Guns, the Gold Coast Race of Stars, and the City of Melbourne Titles again in 2015</p>

            <p>With the support of Sera and talent scout Rob McIntyre, Piastri moved to compete in Europe from 2015 onwards with Kosmic. Vroomkart later contrasted his career path to that of Ayrton Senna, having both progressed from RC racing to European karting after a transcontinental move. In KF-Junior, he claimed twelfth in the European Championship round at Portimão—where he finished twenty-sixth overall—and entered one round of the WSK Super Master Series. In 2016, he returned to Australia to claim his third successive City of Melbourne Titles. In Europe, he joined Ricky Flynn Motorsport, where he finished tenth in the South Garda Winter Cup, twelfth in the WSK Super Master Series, and eighth in the WSK Final Cup. Back-to-back podiums at Portimão saw him claim sixteenth in the European Championship. He qualified fourth for the World Championship at Sakhir after winning his heat; his pre-final saw him drop to eighteenth before recovering to finish sixth overall in his final karting appearance.</p>

            <h3>Formula 4 (2016-2017)</h3>

            </figure>

            <p>Following his sixth-place at the Karting World Championship in OK-Junior, Piastri made his junior formulae debut in the second round of the Formula 4 UAE Championship at Yas Marina with Dragon F4; in a nine-driver field, he claimed sixth, fifth, fourth, and fifth on debut. He then scored a pair of fourth-places at Dubai before claiming two podiums on his return to Yas Marina—his final appearance in the series, ending the season sixth overall having contested 11 of 18 races.</p>

            <p>Piastri moved to the F4 British Championship for 2017 with Arden, owned by Christian Horner—who later revealed he turned down the chance to sign Piastri to the Red Bull Junior Team. He opened his campaign with two podiums at Brands Hatch, which he repeated in the third race at Donington Park, marred by the accident of Billy Monger. After another podium at Thruxton, he claimed his maiden F4 victory in the second race at Oulton Park to move second in the championship. Podiums in each race at Croft and two victories from pole position each at Snetterton and Knockhill consolidated his position. He came under pressure from Logan Sargeant after two retirements at Rockingham. A triple podium at Silverstone, including victory in the final race, extended his advantage, before clinching the runner-up spot to the second-year Jamie Caroline with top-five finishes at Brands Hatch. He closed the season on 376.5 points—20.5 ahead of Sargeant and 65.5 behind Caroline—with six victories from 15 podiums and six pole positions. He later credited "learning from [his] mistakes in F4" as his greatest lesson in junior formulae</p>
      
            <h3>Formula Renault 2.0 (2017-2019)</h3>
            <p>In 2018, Piastri made his debut in the championship, reuniting with Arden. Claiming three podiums, with a highest placed finish of second at the second race at Hockenheim, he finished the season ninth in the championship. In December 2018, it was announced Piastri would switch to reigning team champions R-ace GP for the 2019 championship. He claimed his first victory in the series at Silverstone and repeated with a second win at the same venue a day later. He became the first driver to win three races in 2019 after taking victory at Spa-Francorchamps in July, and became the champion after taking a win and fourth place at the final round at Yas Marina.</p>

            <h3>FIA Formula 3 (2020)</h3>

            </figure>
            <p>In December 2018, Piastri took part in the GP3 Series post-season test at Yas Marina with Trident. In October 2019, Piastri joined the post-season test with reigning FIA Formula 3 team champions Prema Racing. In January 2020, the Italian outfit signed Piastri to contest the upcoming season, alongside Logan Sargeant and 2019 Formula Regional European champion Frederik Vesti. Piastri started third on the grid for his debut race at the Red Bull Ring. He collided with pole-sitter Sebastián Fernández at the first corner but avoided damage and went on to take victory. He then stated that "he thought [his] first Formula 3 race had ended in the first 10 seconds." Piastri took three consecutive second-place finishes at both Hungaroring races and the first Silverstone feature race, before his first retirement of the season came at the following Silverstone sprint race when a stuck-open DRS forced him to withdraw. Teammate Sargeant took the lead of the championship from Piastri at the second Silverstone feature race after Piastri struggled with reliability issues in qualifying. Piastri started fifth for the sprint race in Barcelona, but overtook multiple cars to take the lead before the end of the first lap. He held his position to take his second victory</p>

            <p>Piastri reclaimed the championship lead after finishing fifth at the following Spa-Francorchamps feature race, but dropped back again after being penalised for an illegal overtake in the sprint race, which Sargeant won. Piastri was penalised in qualifying at Monza for impeding Jake Hughes and started the feature race in 15th place. He charged to third place by the end of the race, benefiting from Sargeant being involved in a collision, to retake the championship lead. Piastri retired from the sprint race after he was hit by Clément Novalak, but was also issued a five-place grid penalty for the next race for earlier forcing David Beckmann off the track. Despite his retirement, Piastri maintained the lead of the championship after his teammates collided with each other. Piastri lined up 16th on the grid for the final feature race at the Mugello Circuit and failed to score points after finishing 11th. Title rival Sargeant finished sixth, leaving both drivers tied on 160 points going into the final race. Sargeant started the sprint race six places ahead of Piastri, but was eliminated after a collision on the first lap. Piastri's only remaining title rival, Théo Pourchaire, was unable to bridge the points gap and Piastri finished seventh to claim the championship title, three points ahead of Pourchaire and four ahead of Sargeant</p>
        
            <h3>FIA Formula 2 (2021)</h3>
            <p>Piastri remained with Prema for his 2021 campaign in FIA Formula 2, replacing Mick Schumacher to partner Ferrari Driver Academy member Robert Shwartzman. He debuted in Formula Two machinery during the three-day 2020 post-season test at Sakhir. Prior to the season, he stated that he was expecting a "very challenging year", with plans to remain in the category for two years. Piastri qualified seventh on debut at Sakhir, finishing fifth in the reverse-grid first sprint race. Starting sixth for the second sprint, he took his maiden victory after seven overtakes in the closing seven laps, following a pit stop for option tyres behind the safety car, claiming the lead from Zhou Guanyu on the final tour. He then made several overtakes to lead the feature, before retiring amidst a collision with Dan Ticktum while battling for third on the antepenultimate lap. Qualifying third in both Monte Carlo and Baku, he claimed second in the second sprint and feature at the former, as well as the latter feature. Following his maiden pole position at Silverstone, he finished sixth, fourth, and third to claim the championship lead from Zhou. After ending fourth and seventh in the Monza sprints, he won the feature from pole in a battle with Zhou, which he repeated at Sochi with Théo Pourchaire. He took two further victories at Jeddah: he won the second sprint and the feature from pole, the latter being aborted in the wake of several red flag incidents. </p>
                
            <p>His fifth consecutive pole at Yas Island saw him start tenth in the first sprint, where he claimed third in a late battle with teammate and runner-up Shwartzman to clinch the title; he closed the season with his record fourth successive feature victory.</p>
                
            <p>Across his campaign, Piastri took 252.5 points—60.5 ahead of Shwartzman—with six wins from 11 podiums and five pole positions. He became the sixth driver in history to win the GP2/F2 title in their rookie season,[note 5] the third to win the GP3/F3 and GP2/F2 titles in successive seasons,[note 6] and the first to win Formula Renault, Formula Three, and Formula Two—or equivalent—championships in successive seasons. He was named FIA Rookie of the Year for his efforts in 2021, stating "[he had] done basically everything [he] could [to prove himself]"</p>
