        <p> Hi! My name is Lauren Ward, and I am a senior in Information Science passionate about UX Design. I would love to work in the health, aerospace, or tech industries. 
            I'm super passionate about topics such as conservation, tech ethics, HCI, among several other topics! Outside of class I'm the president of the Information Science club, INFO Buffs. 
            I also work for an aerospace research lab here at CU and do data analysis for them.</p>
        <p>I'm originally from Corvallis, Oregon, home of Oregon State University. Being from Oregon, I do love the rain. In the rare amount of free time that I have, I really like to hike, spend time outdoor, or snuggle up with my cat Gus and read a good book.</p>

        <h2>This class</h2>
        <p>This course explores the principles, standards, and techniques for creating websites that are accessible, inclusive, and effective across a wide range of users and devices. Emphasizing Universal Design, Web Standards, and accessibility best practices, the class covers topics such as semantic HTML, structured web design, user-centered design, mobile accessibility, and validation tools. Students engage with readings, expert resources, and video lectures to understand how cognitive and design theories impact usability and access. By the end of the course, students will be able to evaluate, code, and design web content that meets accessibility guidelines, supports diverse user needs, and adheres to modern web development standards.</p>
